			We are 11 Squared and we bring two great passions together: high quality artwork & the expression of individuality.
			We design 11 different pieces each month exclusively for the t-shirts we sell, also incorporating guest artist’s from all backgrounds - but with the key being, there will only ever be 121 of them printed onto high-quality, 100% organic cotton T-shirts. Ever. This way you can rest assured knowing that there will only ever be 0.0001613% of the world’s population will ever have the same T-shirt design as you.
			An important thing to note is that because we are dedicated to minimising our waste, so each week we tally up the orders and send them to print - this way we can ensure that we only we only use what we need.
